            <p>
                I've played PSO2NGS for over 1200hrs. Now I'm a member of Nachtimmel Alliance. I'm initially in Ship 4 but due to the lack of content, players, and stability of the market place, I chose to transfer into Ship 2 which is considered the most alive ship at the moment. I had joined Tiramisu in Ship 4, then Pirates, Insidious, Fallen Demons in Ship 2.
