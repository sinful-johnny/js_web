            <p>I love doing High Difficulty Quests, exploring the new way to make more N-meseta, evaluating and comparing the effectiveness among weapons and doing fashion. Especially, I love fashion so much that I ran out of N-Free Salon Pass, my character looks are not the best but surely the cute ones. I obsess with details, which people don't usually notice but I believe that those fine touch would contruct a perfect design that we can't say whether any of them is good but the overall of look is good. The complexity of the design come with the ultimate optimization both aesthetically and mathematically. The philosophy that "People cannot recognize all the details, but they will feel it, the beauty, and enjoy their feeling." led me to make countless of improvements in my character looks day by day.</p>
